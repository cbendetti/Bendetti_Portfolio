I'm a senior at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) studying Statistics and Philosophy. I am looking forward to starting a Masters in Buisness Analytics at the Robert H. Smith School of Buisness at the [University of Maryland](https://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/) in August 2020.

Currently, I'm working at [BETA](https://beta.mn) as an Operations and Marketing Associate. BETA is a non-profit accelerator program for start-ups in the twin cities. My role as President of the Entrepreneurship Club at Macalester College sparked my interest in this position at BETA in order to engage more closely with the local start-up community. When I am not studying or working, I like to spend my time playing tennis as captain of the D3 tennis team at Macalester.

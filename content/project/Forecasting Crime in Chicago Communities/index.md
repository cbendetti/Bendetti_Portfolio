Abstract: 

In this report, with the help of my co-author Alexnder Foster, I explore how historical crime data can be used to predict future crimes in the City of Chicago. A few cities in California have started to implement a predictive policing algorithm, called PredPol, that does just this. PredPol outputs "500x500 square foot" locations for officers to patrol in their "uncommitted time" [@Lam2019] and has been found to be "ten times as efficient as random patrolling" [@o2016weapons]. We use a marginal model to forecast future crimes and we visualize our findings using spatial data in order to explore predictive policing in Chicago.â€¨

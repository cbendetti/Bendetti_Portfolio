Abstract:

 In this paper, I will defend David Lewis' theory of contextualism. First, I explain that Lewis'
 motivation for contextualism is to avoid fallibilism and skepticism. Next, I define contextualism and illustrate Lewis' rules of inclusion and exclusion. After, I engage Lewis' contextualism with Jonathon Vogel's objection concerning "retraction." I conclude that "retraction" is not an objection to Lewis' contextualism and that contextualism is an important and accurate theory of knowledge.

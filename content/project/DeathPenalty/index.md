Abstract:

This is a project that I completed for my Introduction to Data Science class. In this project, I explored the role that race, gender and region play on the implementation of the death penalty in the United States. Thank you to my group members Anna Bebbington, Maxwell Kent, and Dylan Kurzer-Ogul for their work on this project.

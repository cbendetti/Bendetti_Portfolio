Abstract:

Art and language are similar forms of expression that are guided by rules. In Kripke’s “On Rules and Private Language” he asserts that Wittgenstein holds the view that language is necessarily social. In this paper, I show the similarities between art and language and that they are necessarily social. I interact with Nathan Oesch in “Music and Language in Social Interaction: Synchrony, Antiphony, and Functional Origins” to show how music is social because it requires rule-following under a community consensus. In this paper, I explore Kripke’s theory of rule-following and ask the question, is there space for evolution in art if growth requires breaking rules? I conclude that ultimately a community defines if a rule can be broken, therefore there is space within Kripke’s theory.

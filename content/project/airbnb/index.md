Abstract: 

In this report, with the help of my co-author Jane Roarty, I explore the relationship between price and Airbnb listings. The following projects analyze the prices of Airbnb rental listings in all five boroughs of New York City. The five boroughs of New York City include Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, The Bronx, and State Island. The first project explores data from October 2018 and creates a series of linear regression models. The second project uses LASSO and KNN to create more flexible models.

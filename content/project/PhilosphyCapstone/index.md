Abstract: 

In this paper, I will explore the question, “Is it morally permissible to make allocation decisions of police resources based on predictive policing algorithms?”. From my research, I have found that in some cases it is unethical to implement predictive policing for resource allocation. Therefore, the goal of my capstone is to propose three rules as a framework for deciding whether or not it is ethical to use predictive policing for allocating police resources.
